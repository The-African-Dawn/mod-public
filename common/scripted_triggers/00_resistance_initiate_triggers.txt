# checked daily when a country cracks crypto of another country
# game has some hard coded checks to decide if it should enable or not but it will also use these

# scope is target country
# from scope is the ai country that is checking if it should activate its bonuses or not

# you will have access to following temp variables here. these will not be calculated if we are not enemy

# activation_threshold: hard coded activation threshold calculated by ai

# is checked when ai decides not to activate its bonuses. you can override this decision and activate by returning true here
