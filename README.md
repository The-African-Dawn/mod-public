# African Dawn
## The wind of freedom has blown over Africa
The events of the game begin on September 30, 2022: a military coup takes place in Burkina Faso - Captain Ibrahim Traore comes to power.
In the first three years, the player's main goal is to eradicate terrorism in the Sahel. After the inevitable victory over terror, a cold war begins between two blocs - the Alliance of Sahel States (ASS) and the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS).
Pan-Africanists from the ACS, with the support of Russia and its Afrika Korps of the Russian Defense Ministry, oppose the neocolonial powers - France and the USA, as well as their allies from ECOWAS.
During the game, players will have the opportunity to intervene in a number of armed conflicts to strengthen their starting positions before the Great African War, which will provide an opportunity to solve continental problems that have accumulated over many years.
