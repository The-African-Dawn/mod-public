l_english:0 "Abdul Hamid Dbeibah"
l_english: "A businessman, politician, and former associate of Muammar Gaddafi, he was born in 1959 in the western city of Misrata, traditionally considered a stronghold of resistance against Gaddafi's regime. Early in his career, Dbeibah moved to Canada to earn an engineering degree from the University of Toronto. He returned to his hometown amid a construction boom, eventually catching the attention of Gaddafi's close allies.\nHis expertise soon earned him Gaddafi's trust, and in 2007 he was tasked with managing the state-owned Libyan Investment and Development Company (LIDCO), responsible for some of the country's largest public works projects.\nAfter Gaddafi's overthrow in 2011, Dbeibah founded the 'Libya Future' movement, although it did not actively participate in political life.\nOn February 5, 2021, Abdul Hamid Dbeibah was elected Prime Minister of Libya. This choice surprised many, given the construction magnate's close ties to Libya's former long-time ruler Muammar Gaddafi.\nIn September 2021, the Libyan House of Representatives expressed a vote of no confidence in Dbeibah's government. Since February 2022, his position has been contested, and several assassination attempts have been made. This has led to renewed clashes in the country.\nAccording to several media reports, Dbeibah is also said to have ties with the Turkish authorities and the Muslim Brotherhood (an international religious-political association banned in Russia)."
