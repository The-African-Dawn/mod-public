  BRK_State_Info_Text_desc.1: "§W Burkina Faso (until 1984 - Upper Volta) is a country in the Sahel region. In the Mooré language, the name of the country translates as "the land of honest people".\n\nAt the end of the 19th century, the territories of modern Burkina Faso began to be colonized by France. During the 20th century, several anti-colonial uprisings erupted in the country. In 1960, during gradual decolonization, the country declared independence from its former metropolis, but the latter retained its influence through financial institutions.\n\nIn 1983, as a result of a series of coups, Thomas Sankara, a captain in the Burkinabé army with socialist views, came to power. While still at the Military Academy in Antsirabe (Madagascar), he became acquainted with the teachings of K. Marx and V. Lenin. He proclaimed a course for social revolution, established warm relations with the Soviet Union, and, as a logical continuation of his policy, significantly weakened France's influence. It was on his initiative that the country was renamed Burkina Faso in 1984.\n\nDuring his tenure, Sankara carried out a series of major social and economic reforms. Among the goals of the reforms were the elimination of hunger, the creation of a system of free education and healthcare, the fight against epidemics and corruption, and reforestation in the face of desertification (during his presidency, around 7,000 nurseries were created and 10 million trees were planted, halting the southward spread of the Sahara sands). This led to economic growth and allowed for social changes. His reforms brought Burkina Faso to a new level, and Thomas Sankara himself became a national and African hero.\n\nHowever, his policies were not liked by the former metropolis and neighboring countries under its patronage. In 1986, a conference of Burkina Faso's neighboring countries was held with French support, at which the heads of state demanded that the revolutionary president roll back his social initiatives. In 1987, Thomas Sankara was killed in a coup d'état organized by his friend and associate, Blaise Compaoré, who claimed that Sankara was jeopardizing international relations with France and neighboring Côte d'Ivoire.\n\nBlaise Compaoré ruled Burkina Faso for the next 27 years until a coup in 2014, triggered by the president's attempt to amend the constitution to allow him to remain in power for life.\n\nThe Arab Spring and events in Libya gave rise to a large-scale Islamist movement in the Sahel. This led to a jihadist uprising in Burkina Faso in 2015. The country's government actively used French military support, but over the years, the problem was not resolved, and there was growing dissatisfaction in society with the presence of French forces. The population constantly suffered from terrorist attacks, and discontent was brewing in the army, which was frustrated with the authorities' leniency toward French crimes against the country. This led to a coup in January 2022, but significant changes in policy did not occur.\n\nIn September 2022, another military coup took place, and Ibrahim Traoré came to power, breaking ties with France and establishing warm relations with Russia. He is the successor to the ideas of Thomas Sankara. §!"

  MLL_State_Info_Text_desc.1: "§W Mali is a country in the Sahel region. It has extensive mineral resources, including gold.\n\nThe territories of Mali became part of French Africa in 1889 under the name French Sudan. In 1932, Upper Volta, the future Burkina Faso, was included in French Sudan. In 1958, French Sudan and Senegal formed the Mali Federation. This state entity became independent in 1960 during the colonial crisis, but that same year, Senegal left the federation.\n\nMali's first president, Modibo Keita, began a course towards socialist revolution. He announced large-scale reforms in education, medicine, and agriculture. The former colony, which did not have its own industry, acquired various types of small and heavy industry factories. Modibo also announced the country's exit from the CFA franc zone, which was tied to the French franc, and the creation of the Malian franc to give the country financial independence. However, in 1968, Moussa Traoré conducted a coup in the country and came to power. As Traoré later admitted, the conspiracy was instigated by French intelligence services, particularly by the intelligence legend, Secretary-General for African Affairs, Jacques Foccart.\n\nFrom 1968 to 1991, the country was ruled by General Moussa Traoré, who reversed Modibo's reforms, returned the country to the CFA franc zone under political pressure from France, handed over the gold reserves, and allowed French interests to take control of key mining positions. Mali has no gold reserves in its banks, despite owning 860 gold mines and producing 50 tons of gold per year. His overthrow was caused by reforms carried out under pressure from the IMF, which led to a significant decrease in the already low standard of living. The population increasingly demanded the resignation of the head of state and the abolition of the one-party system.\n\nIn 2012, after the events in Libya, Tuaregs fled from the Libyan army to Mali and started an uprising. Having received military training and looted Gaddafi's arsenals, the Tuaregs, in alliance with jihadists, captured ⅔ of the country's territory. The authorities appealed to France for help, and it sent a military contingent to fight the Islamists, starting Operation Barkhane. However, the fight was sluggish, causing dissatisfaction among the Malian army and ordinary people. Moreover, facts about French military cooperation with the Tuaregs began to surface more frequently. It turned out that it was the French forces behind the Tuareg uprisings and the coordination of their actions to destabilize the country's situation, which led to increased economic, political, and military control of France over Mali.\n\nIn 2021, a military coup took place, during which the president and government were arrested. Assimi Goïta, an officer in the Malian army widely respected by the ranks, came to power. §!"

Throughout the 20th century, Islamic preachers, enjoying local support, raised uprisings and led anti-colonial struggles. In Niger, French colonizers developed agriculture to extract cotton and transport infrastructure for the delivery of extracted natural resources. In 1960, during the colonial crisis, Niger declared its independence.\n\nAfter gaining independence, the Nigerien Armed Forces were formed from former members of the French colonial troops: they were led by the French, who agreed to take joint French-Nigerien citizenship. In 1960, there were only ten African officers in the Nigerien army. France retained its influence in other areas as well.\n\nFrench uranium mining corporations also had a key influence on the country's internal and external policies. Having access to strategic resources, France promised to protect the new leaders not only from external threats but also from possible coups. However, this did not shield Nigerien leaders from being overthrown, and in some cases, France itself removed undesirable leaders. In 1974, Hamani Diori became a victim of a coup supported by Paris immediately after demanding higher prices for uranium. Thirty years later, President Mamadou Tandja made the same mistake. After achieving a significant increase in prices for his resources and the ability to sell them to other trading partners besides France, predominantly China, Mamadou Tandja was overthrown in 2010.\n\nIn 2011, Mahamadou Issoufou, a mining engineer educated in France and a former employee of Areva (now Orano), a French company specializing in nuclear energy, became the president of Niger. He was re-elected for a new term in 2016.\n\nAfter 2011, and with the rise of jihadist movements in the country, the security problem worsened. French armed forces provided support to the Nigerien Armed Forces, but their activities raised many questions among the public and military leaders. Anti-French sentiments were growing, and demands to expel French forces from the country were becoming louder.\n\nIn 2021, Mohamed Bazoum, also an ally of France, won the presidential election. Just days before the inauguration of the elected president, there was an attempted coup, which failed.§!"

It possesses extensive reserves of oil and gas, as well as a crucial geographical position, lying on several major logistical routes.\n\nIn 1951, Libya was proclaimed an independent sovereign state—the United Kingdom of Libya, headed by King Idris I.\n\nIn 1969, a group of young officers, including Khalifa Haftar, led by Muammar Gaddafi, overthrew the king and declared the Libyan Arab Republic. The new authorities adopted the ideology of Arab socialism and began to implement it. By 1970, US, French, and British military personnel had left the country. In 1977, the Libyan Arab Republic was renamed the Socialist People's Libyan Arab Jamahiriya. In 1978, the Libyan army intervened in the Chadian civil war to counter French influence in the region. However, in the end, the Libyan army was unsuccessful and had to retreat.\n\nSimultaneously, from the 1980s, Libya began conducting research in the field of nuclear technology, enlisting the help of the USSR. The Soviet Union also attempted to build a nuclear power plant in Libya, but the project was frozen due to imposed sanctions. Libya also tried to acquire nuclear weapons, but in 2004 the country's authorities acknowledged the non-proliferation regime and announced the cessation of secret programs.\n\nIn 2011, the "Arab Revolution" erupted in all Arab countries, including Libya. The crisis in Libya was aggravated by NATO countries' bombing of the country to support opposition forces in overthrowing Muammar Gaddafi. As a result, in the fall of 2011, Gaddafi was captured by rebels and torn apart by a mob.\n\nAfter the overthrow of Gaddafi's regime, the entire region plunged into chaos. Instability engulfed neighboring countries, particularly Mali, where a civil war began with Tuaregs arriving from Libya along with the Libyan army's arsenal. With the collapse of a strong regional power, radical Islamist ideas spread, terrorists looted rich weapon stockpiles and spread throughout North Africa and the Sahel. Today, parts of Libyan territory are controlled by Islamist terrorist groups. Regional chaos has led to the rise of illegal arms and drug trafficking.\n\nCurrently, Libya has two governments that do not recognize each other. The country is effectively divided into two parts. Each part has foreign military contingents supporting one or another government. The Government of National Accord in Tripoli in the west of the country is recognized by the UN and supported by Western countries and Turkey. The interim government, supported by the Libyan National Army led by Khalifa Haftar, controls the east of the country and enjoys the support of Russian forces.§!"

The official language is French, with Arabic also being used.\n\nChad has vast reserves of oil, uranium, gold, and other resources.\n\nChad was colonized by France in the late 19th century. Compared to other colonies, Chad developed more slowly, with virtually no modernization. The colony was viewed as a source of cheap labor for cotton production.\n\nIn November 1958, the country became a republic with limited autonomy within the French Community.\n\nChad declared independence on August 11, 1960.\n\nAfter gaining independence, conflicts between the northern Arab (Islamic) and southern African (Christian) communities intensified, leading to armed clashes.\n\nIn 1966, the National Liberation Front of Chad (FROLINAT) was established.\n\nIn the 1970s, Chad had a theocratic Arab state led by Rabah.\n\nFrom 1978 to 1982, a military conflict occurred between Libya and France on one side and Chadian rebels on the other. The conflict began due to Libya's interference in Chad's internal affairs.\n\nFrom 1982 to 1985, Chad underwent political changes. In June 1982, the anti-Libyan movement "Northern Armed Forces" led by Hissène Habré came to power. In 1982, Felix Malloum became chairman of the new junta.\n\nIn 1985, Habré reconciled with some of his opponents, including the Democratic Front of Chad (DFT) and the Coordinating Committee of the Democratic Revolutionary Council.\n\nIn 1986, the "Toyota War," the last phase of the Chadian-Libyan conflict, began, lasting from 1986 to 1987. The war ended in 1987 with a complete defeat for the Libyans, who lost 7,500 soldiers and a significant amount of equipment.\n\nIn 1990, another coup occurred, bringing Idriss Déby to power. During this period, the country faced political instability, driven by the expansion of security forces' powers and the growing influence of former rebels. Chad's economy remained underdeveloped, and the country depended on foreign financial aid and military-political support from Western powers.\n\nIn 2005, Déby was re-elected for a second term. In 2011, he announced his intention to run for a third term, but the Constitutional Court overturned his decision. In October 2015, a state of emergency was declared due to threats from terrorist organizations. In 2016, Déby again attempted to run for a third term, but the Supreme Court annulled the election results.\n\nIn 2016, a rebel movement against the Chadian government began. From 2016 to 2018, Chad experienced a political crisis. In 2018, a new constitution was adopted, coming into effect on May 4 of that year.\n\nIn April 2021, an armed conflict erupted in the country. The rebellion was initiated by the Chadian rebel group "Front for Change and Concord in Chad." In 2021, former Chadian President Idriss Déby was killed in battle.\n\nIn 2022, a ceasefire agreement was signed between the Chadian government and several rebel groups.

  SNG_State_Info_Text_desc.1: "§WIn the pre-colonial era, Senegal was one of the centers of the African slave trade. Local chieftains exchanged slaves for weapons with Europeans, thus fighting each other for power. Due to its geographical location and economic importance, the coast of modern Senegal and the mouth of the Senegal River were among the first to be colonized by French conquerors in the 16th century. Later, Britain contested these territories and during the Seven Years' War in 1758 managed to capture them, only to later return them to the French. The development of inland territories began only in the second half of the 19th century. Slavery was abolished in Senegal only in 1849. In 1895, the colony became part of French West Africa. French authorities actively built railroads to export the country's resources, primarily gold and peanuts.\n\nDuring World War II, Senegal became a field of confrontation between pro-Hitler Vichy France and de Gaulle's Free France. In 1940, de Gaulle, with the support of British allies, tried to sway Senegal to his side, where the gold reserves of the French Bank and the Polish government-in-exile were stored. However, diplomatic efforts failed, and the military operation was unsuccessful. The colonial authorities remained loyal to Vichy France. After World War II, a national liberation movement gained momentum.\n\nIn 1960, Senegal, merging with French Sudan (Mali), created the Mali Federation and declared its independence. However, the federation dissolved the same year, forming two independent states.\n\nAfter gaining independence, the country was governed by left-wing forces who declared the construction of "African socialism." In 1976, an amendment to the constitution was adopted, allowing three political parties to operate in Senegal. Other leftist parties remained underground until the early 1980s, when their activities were legalized.\n\nIn 1981, Senegal, at the request of the Gambian president, invaded Gambia to suppress a rebellion organized by Pan-African forces. This move was condemned by the opposition, but Senegalese forces, with support from the British SAS, suppressed the uprising.\n\nFollowing this, in 1982, Senegalese authorities with territorial claims on Gambia persuaded Gambia to form the Senegambian Confederation. However, the expected integration did not occur, and the confederation dissolved in 1989.\n\nSimultaneously, in 1982, the separatist organization "Movement of Democratic Forces of Casamance" (MFDC) began armed struggle in Casamance, a region of Senegal. The organization continues its activities today, enjoying support from Gambia, which has claims to the territory. In the 1990s, the Senegalese government tried to resolve the separatist issue peacefully: a regionalization law was adopted, and a ceasefire agreement was signed. However, these measures had only a temporary effect. In 2004, an agreement was signed between MFDC and the Senegalese authorities, but the conflict reignited in 2007.\n\nIn 2017, Senegal, as part of ECOWAS combined forces, conducted another intervention in Gambia, removing the losing and refusing-to-resign president Yahya Jammeh from office. The election winner Adama Barrow took power. Apart from Senegal, Nigeria, Ghana, Mali, and Togo participated in the invasion.\n\nToday, Senegal is one of the most stable countries in the Sahel: terrorist organizations are not widespread, and constitutional crises are not exacerbated.§!"

It was the main means of supporting the return of free African Americans to Africa.\n\nIn 1821, American soldiers annexed Cape Mesurado and founded the city of Monrovia. Later, in 1822, the colony of Liberia was established (declared independence in 1847), and trade ties with Sierra Leone were established.\n\nThe establishment of Liberia was initially proposed as a "cure" for slavery. ACS, heavily influenced by religion, called its activities a "mission to spread Christianity and compassion in Africa." However, various parties opposed this type of colonization – African Americans wanted to be granted equal rights in America, not outside of it.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, relations with Ethiopia were established. The achieved agreements included granting most-favored-nation status, lasting until Italy's invasion of Ethiopia in 1935. After World War II, relations between the two countries redeveloped. In 1957, Richard Nixon visited Ethiopia and called it "one of the USA's most loyal and consistent allies."\n\nAfter the Cold War, the USA adhered to a policy of "neglect" towards Africa, focusing its attention on other regions of the world. Moreover, American security interests overshadowed the promotion of democracy and African security priorities in what could be called "B. Obama's secret wars in Africa." Militarization of policy in Africa accelerated – total military expenditures on the continent were estimated at $7 billion.\n\nIn 2008, the African Command of the Armed Forces (AFRICOM) was created. American military bases and outposts became the main conductors for protecting US interests in Africa.\n\nAFRICOM participated in NATO activities in Libya, combating piracy in the Gulf of Guinea, illegal drug trafficking, and terrorism in West Africa.\n\nThe USA also used AFRICOM with the involvement of American military advisors scattered across bases in Congo, South Sudan, Ethiopia, Uganda, and the Central African Republic for surveillance and intelligence.\n\nIn 2022, the Biden administration adopted the "US Strategy for Sub-Saharan Africa," noting that the private defense sector would assist African countries' armed forces in technology and energy areas. The US Department of Defense stated the need to establish cooperation with Africa due to "risks of negative activities by China and Russia" on the continent.\n\nThe activation of policy and the presence of many military bases indicate the continent's importance in terms of minerals and rare metals necessary for technological development and US national security, competing with China over their mining.\n\nAn important feature of US Africa policy is that the president rarely takes direct part in its development, delegating it to the level of assistant secretary of state. The State Department, the Department of Commerce, the Pentagon, and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) do not always have coordinated or synchronized strategies in Africa.§!"

In 1843, a protectorate was established over Tunisia, and in 1846, France established control over the entire Ivory Coast.\n\nIn 1881, France received a concession to build a railroad in Chad, and in 1883 – to build a railroad in Upper Volta (modern Burkina Faso).\n\nIn 1886, France signed a secret agreement with Great Britain to divide spheres of influence in Africa, and in 1904 – a treaty of friendship and alliance with Morocco.\n\nBy 1904, the conquest of West Africa was completed. The administrative reform in the colonies was also completed by this year. Previously divided into military territories under local officers' control, the West African colonies were finally brought under the administration of a single governor of French West Africa, with its capital in Dakar. This colonial formation also included French Congo, although formally in Central Africa and lacking land borders with other colonies.\n\nIn 1912, France received a concession to build a railroad in Cameroon, and in 1913 – to build a railroad in Chad.\n\nIn 1922, France received a League of Nations mandate to govern Togoland and Cameroon, and in 1946 – to govern Madagascar.\n\nDuring World War II, Africa became a battlefield for two opposing French regimes – Vichy, which swore allegiance to Nazi Germany, and Charles de Gaulle's "Free France."\n\nAfter World War II, the process of decolonization began in Africa. The Fourth Republic was proclaimed in 1958, and France recognized the independence of Tunisia and Morocco in 1959.

This system included France's military-political, economic, and cultural-ideological presence in the region.\n\nParis actively used cooperation agreements to maintain its involvement in the economic life of former colonies and control over the regimes established there.

The Russian Empire sought the support of Morocco, Egypt, and Tunisia in opposing the Ottoman Empire. In 1869, diplomatic relations were established with Tunisia, in 1897 with Morocco, and in 1898 with Ethiopia and the Republic of Transvaal (modern South Africa).\n\nThe imperial press published materials sympathizing with the fate of African slaves.

In the former partner countries of the Union, there was a rise in pro-Western positions.\n\nAfter gaining independence, ideas of pan-Africanism developed among the African intelligentsia. The leader of the pan-African movement was Ghanaian President Kwame Nkrumah, who proposed the idea of creating the United States of Africa. Based on these ideas, the Organization of African Unity was established in 1963.\n\nWhen Muammar Gaddafi came to power in Libya, he also actively promoted the idea of creating a unified African state, and in 1999 began discussing the creation of the African Union and a single currency to unite the continent's capabilities.\n\nIn 1994, apartheid was finally dismantled in South Africa, bringing to power the country's first black president and one of the most famous human rights activists - Nelson Mandela.\n\nAt the same time, the civil war in Somalia reignited. After the overthrow of Siad Barre, the rebels began clan wars among themselves. The humanitarian crisis forced the UN to send a peacekeeping mission (UNOSOM), which included large US forces.\n\nIn 1994, an ethnic conflict erupted in Rwanda between the Hutu and Tutsi tribes, leading to the genocide of the Tutsis. Estimates of the death toll from these events range from 500,000 to 1.1 million people.\n\nIn 2002, the Organization of African Unity was renamed the African Union, which currently includes 55 countries. It symbolizes the hope of African nations for achieving peace and prosperity on the continent. The AU is guided by the principle of pan-Africanism: "African problems require African solutions."\n\nIn 2011, the countries of North Africa were shaken by the "Arab Spring." This led to regime changes in Egypt, Tunisia, Algeria, Sudan, and mass protests affected Morocco, Western Sahara, Mauritania, Djibouti. In Libya, Western countries conducted a "humanitarian intervention" - bombing Libyan cities, primarily carried out by the US and France. These actions led to the final overthrow of M.
