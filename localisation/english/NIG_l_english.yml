 NIG.1.t:0 "Niger is engulfed in the flames of change."
 NIG.1.desc:0 "News from Niger alarmed the world today. A military coup has ousted President Mohamed Bazoum, putting the future of the country in doubt. Thousands of people took to the streets of the capital Niamey, celebrating the fall of the regime and waving Russian flags.\n\n\nThis coup was another link in a long chain of political instability that has haunted Niger since its independence from France in 1960. The country has already experienced four military coups, each for a complex set of reasons ranging from economic problems to accusations of corruption and inefficiency in government.\n\n\n\nThe military that took power declared its commitment to fighting terrorism, which in recent years has become a serious threat to the region. However, their sharply negative remarks against France and the U.S., accusations of neo-colonialism and exploitation, have raised serious concerns among Western powers."

 NIG_Abdourahamane_Tchiani_desc:0 "Little is known about Tchiani's childhood: he is definitely from the Tillaberi region, from which most of the Niger Army originates. He joined the army in 1984 and later enrolled at the National School for Active Officers in Thiès, Senegal. He later attended army training in France and the United States. Abdurahmane Tchiani has extensive experience in the army, having commanded units of the Nigerian army whose main purpose was to combat drug trafficking. He has served with UN peacekeeping troops in Côte d'Ivoire, Sudan and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. He was a member of the Multinational Joint Task Force created by Niger, Chad, Nigeria and Cameroon to fight the terrorist group Boko Haram. In 2011, Tchiani took command of the Presidential Guard and was promoted to General in 2018. In 2015, Tchiani was accused of plotting against Issoufou, then president, but he pleaded not guilty and was acquitted in court. Moreover, Tchiani led the foiling of a coup attempt in 2021, ahead of the inauguration of Niger's new president, Mohamed Bazoum."
 NIG_ahmed_baza_desc:0 "Bazoum has vast experience and seniority in the political sphere. He was born in 1960 in Southeast Niger in the small locality of Bilabrin in a family belonging to the Arab minority. In 1984, he graduated from the Department of Literature and Humanities of the Faculty of Philosophy of the University of Dakar (Senegal). He obtained a master's degree in political philosophy and continued his postgraduate studies in logic and epistemology. From 1984 to 1991, Mohamed Bazoum taught philosophy at schools in Tahoua and Maradi. By the early 1990s, he had become politically active, joined trade unions and in December 1990 became one of the founders of the Party for Democracy and Socialism of Niger. The following year, he took part in a national conference, which led to the first multiparty parliamentary and presidential elections in the country in 1993. Bazoum then began to hold government posts: Secretary of State for Cooperation under the Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation in the transitional government, Minister of Foreign Affairs and Cooperation in the government of Prime Minister Hama Amadou. \After a series of coups d'état, Bazoum remained in the Nigerian political arena. In 2011, the chairman of his party won the presidential election and stepped down, handing the post to Bazoum. Mohamed himself became Minister of Foreign Affairs, and after his re-election in 2016, Bazoum became Minister of the Interior. \In 2021, Bazoum was elected president of the country. A few days before the inauguration, there was an attempted coup d'état, which was foiled. "

The government has decided to "revoke the privileges and immunities granted" under the EU military partnership mission and therefore "has no legal obligations" with regard to the said partnership, the statement said.

 NIG.14.a:0 "The main thing is that it should not harm ECOWAS."
 NIG.14.b:0 "It is to our advantage."
 NIG.14.c:0 "At this rate, ECOWAS will collapse."
 NIG.15.t:0 "ECOWAS never intervened in Niger".
 NIG.15.desc:0 "Despite formidable promises on both sides and troop concentrations on the border, ECOWAS never decided to conduct an ECOMOG mission inside Niger. This was probably due to the internal ECOWAS split over divided opinion on the Niger insurgency. Some members of parliament have declared their support for the new Nigerian government, even though the ECOWAS military leadership, after Niger's refusal to comply with the ultimatum, has already drawn up a plan and set a date for the invasion.\n/pThe French and US leaders, who had previously supported the intervention, declined to comment on the matter.\n/p Apparently, Africa can breathe a sigh of relief that a full-scale war has not taken place."
 NIG.15.a:0 "That doesn't mean ECOWAS will forget about the rebels."
 NIG.15.b:0 "It's a victory!"
 NIG.15.c:0 "Well, there will be no war."
