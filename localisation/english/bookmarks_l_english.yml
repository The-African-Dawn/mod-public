 GATHERING_STORM_NAME:0 "The Wind of Freedom Swept Over Africa"
 GATHERING_STORM_DESC:0 "After the collapse of the bipolar world, neocolonialism has risen again. Choking on civil strife, debt, and social problems, African countries cannot maintain their sovereignty against stronger powers. However, there is a growing demand worldwide for a more just world order, and Africa will not be an exception. Perhaps this time, the wind of freedom will return."
