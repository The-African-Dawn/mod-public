 NRG_black_axe_cult:0 "Black Axe Cult" 
 NRG_black_axe_cult_desc:0 "The Neo-Black Movement of Africa, from which Black Axe emerged, sprang up on Nigerian campuses in the 1970s as a Black Power liberation movement, and its anti-colonial, pan-African message soon captured the imaginations of thousands of young people. Nigerian fraternities had existed since the 1950s, but the NBM founders believed such groups had descended into empty sloganeering. Inspired by the American Black Panther Party, NBM chose a more militant path. Its logo was an axe breaking the shackles of a slave, and its colors were black (for blackness), white (for peace), and yellow (for intelligence). It developed a strict code of conduct and a quarterly journal filled with self-help, poetry and agitprop, called Black Axe.\n\nToday, the NBM spans continents, and by its own account numbers some thirty thousand members. NBM leaders maintain that their group has evolved from a student fraternity into an international NGO dedicated to ‘the equality and social justice for all’. But many in Nigeria and abroad consider this image a sham. Law enforcement officials who have investigated the group say that, over the last four decades, the growth in criminality amongst its membership has corrupted the NBM\n\nCrimes linked to Black Axe are a staple of Nigerian news. They are one of many “cults”, as the fraternities are commonly called in Nigeria. Some dismiss its members as street thugs. Others say they are dangerous Illuminati, with prominent members in politics, the military, and law enforcement who pull the levers of Nigerian power and are connected to criminal rackets in Europe and North America."
