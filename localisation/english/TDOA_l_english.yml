Such dependence inhibits the development of other sectors of the economy, increases monospecialization, and, accordingly, increases the risks of further development. For example, it is difficult to explain to a university graduate why he should go into science, engage in new technologies, although it is obvious that he will earn much more in the oil industry. Therefore, the vast majority of economies with a high share of oil in exports in the long term (20-30 years) grow significantly slower than developed diversified economies, although there may be short periods of rapid growth due to high prices."
