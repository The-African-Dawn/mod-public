This has a particularly strong impact on girls, who are most likely to drop out of school due to conflict and early marriage.\nIn addition, the quality of education in Burkina Faso remains low due to a shortage of qualified teachers, teaching materials, and infrastructure.

French military bases and counter-terrorism operations in the Sahel are often seen as an attempt to maintain control over former colonies and their resources. Critics argue that French interference undermines the sovereignty of Burkina Faso and other countries in the region.\nThe United States is also increasing its military presence in Burkina Faso under the pretext of fighting terrorism and ensuring stability. However, many believe that the true motives of the United States are related to the desire to gain access to the country's natural resources and strengthen its geopolitical influence in Africa.\nEconomic pressure from international financial institutions such as the IMF and the World Bank is also seen as a form of neocolonialism. The imposition of harsh lending conditions and structural reforms often leads to cuts in social spending, rising poverty, and political instability.\nTo overcome the crisis, Burkina Faso needs to assert its sovereignty and the right to self-determination.

 BRK.33.t:0 "\"72 Hours of Local Milk\": A Taste of Hope Amidst the Crisis"
 BRK.33.desc:0 "As Burkina Faso grapples with security challenges, the country's people have not lost their optimism and desire for development.\n\nThe National Union of Mini-Dairies and Milk Producers of Burkina Faso (UMPL/B) has announced the eighth edition of its \"72 Hours of Local Milk\" competition, to be held from 25 to 27 October in Ouagadougou.\n\nBut behind the festive name lies serious problems faced by local producers. \"Mini-dairies are facing a security crisis,\" admits UMPL/B president Adama Ibrahim Diallo.\n\nHowever, the forum organizers are not giving up. \"This year we want to... see how we're going to get out of the situation,\" Diallo said.\n\nOn the agenda are not only competitions and tastings. There are plans to discuss strategies to support local producers, hold a fair trade congress, and even strengthen ties with European partners.\n\nThe UMPL/B initiative is a shining example of the resilience of the people of Burkina Faso. Despite the difficulties, they continue to develop domestic production and seek new avenues for growth. \"Fair milk means that the producer must win... and the processor wins, and that the consumer is proud to consume what comes from us,\" Diallo stressed. And perhaps it is this belief in their own strength that will help Burkina Faso overcome all challenges."

To protect our Motherland, our people, our future, the government has decided to introduce general mobilization.\n\nHenceforth, in accordance with the law, the state is vested with emergency powers.\n\n- Every citizen of Burkina Faso of military age is obliged to stand up for the defense of the Motherland. Evasion of military service will be punished to the fullest extent of the law.\n- All resources necessary for waging war - industrial enterprises, transport, raw materials, food - are transferred to the control of the state.\n- Everyone who possesses knowledge, skills or property that can help to achieve victory is obliged to place them at the disposal of the government.\n\nThis is not an easy decision, but it is dictated by necessity.

 BRK.34.desc:0 "\nYesterday, at an emergency meeting of the Council of Ministers, the Transitional Government of Burkina Faso decided to introduce general mobilization in the country. Aboubakar Sawadogo, Minister of Sports, Youth and Employment, officially announced this.\n\n\"Faced with serious security threats, Burkina Faso is forced to rely on the unity and determination of its citizens,\" said the Minister of State, Minister of Defence and Veterans Affairs, Colonel Major Kassoum Coulibaly. - \"The salvation of the nation depends on how selflessly each of its sons and daughters are willing to fight for its future.\"\n\nThe official statement published by the presidential press service stresses that the decree on general mobilization provides the state with the necessary legal levers to combat terrorism and ensure security."

 BRK.35.desc:0 "\n\nA heavy atmosphere hung over the administration building in Ouagadougou, where a meeting of senior government officials with representatives of various public organizations of Burkina Faso took place today. Officially, the main topic of the event was the coordination of actions in the field of security.\n\nThe central figure of the meeting was the Minister of Defence, Colonel Major Kassoum Coulibaly. His speech, according to eyewitnesses, was unexpectedly harsh. Coulibaly made it clear that Burkina Faso does not intend to rely on outside help in the fight against terrorism and is ready to independently ensure security on its territory. \"We are not asking foreign soldiers to fight for us," local media quoted the minister as saying, \"Burkina Faso is only asking for the resources it needs to fight those who sow chaos and violence.\"\n\nBut much more attention was drawn to Coulibaly's words about a certain \"international coalition\" operating against Burkina Faso. The minister did not go into details, did not name specific names or organizations, but made it clear that the threat comes not only from terrorist groups, but also from external forces pursuing their own goals in the region.\n\nThe defense minister's statements, made behind closed doors, nevertheless quickly leaked to the press and raised many questions in society. What is the true extent of the threat to Burkina Faso? Who is behind the mysterious \"coalition\"? And what steps will the government take to protect the country from external and internal enemies? There are no answers to these questions yet, but one thing is certain - clouds are gathering over Burkina Faso."

 BRK.36.desc:0 "\n\nBurkina Faso's National Call Center (CNA), set up just a month ago to combat terrorism and corruption, is showing its first successes. According to Nestor Noufé, Director of Public Relations for the President of Faso, thanks to calls to the hotline, five militants have already laid down their arms and surrendered to the authorities.\n\nAccording to Noufé, CNA operators receive and process an average of 81 calls and messages daily, most of which relate to security issues and acts of terrorist activity. \"Citizens report suspicious persons and movements, planned terrorist attacks, and cases of extortion and violence," Noufé said.\n\nThe CNA also plays an important role in the implementation of the national reconciliation program. \"Thanks to the call center, fighters who want to lay down their arms and return to civilian life can get the information and assistance they need," stressed the presidential administration official.\n\nTo date, five former militants have managed to come out of hiding and join the reintegration program. Experts call this a modest but important step towards restoring peace in Burkina Faso."

As a result of raids carried out from 27 to 29 April in the central regions of the country, 21 people suspected of involvement in the illegal trafficking of fuel were detained.\n\n\"This operation is part of our strategy to combat terrorist financing sources,\" a gendarmerie official said. According to him, militants receive significant funds from smuggling, which they use to purchase weapons, transport, and recruit new members.\n\nDuring the raids, about 20,000 liters of fuel were seized, and clandestine warehouses and vehicles involved in illegal transportation were discovered. Among the confiscated items were minibuses with converted cabins, motorcycles, as well as fuel stored in canisters and bottles.\n\nAccording to the investigation, the smugglers acted within the framework of an extensive network that passed through several regions of the country and neighboring states. \"We are continuing the investigation to identify and bring to justice all those involved in this criminal scheme," the gendarmerie assured."
