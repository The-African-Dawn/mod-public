 CHD_Mahamat_Idriss_desc: "Mahamat Idriss Déby Itno was born on April 4, 1984, in N'Djamena. He is also known as \"Kaka,\" which means \"grandmother,\" as Déby Jr. was raised mainly by his paternal grandmother during his childhood. \nHe is the son of the late Chadian president Idriss Déby and a prominent figure in Chad's political and military landscape. Déby’s upbringing was shaped by his family’s deep involvement in Chadian politics and military affairs. \nHe received his education at the Groupement des écoles militaires interarmées du Tchad in Chad and underwent training in France at the Aix-en-Provence military school. Upon his return, he served in the Directorate-General of the Presidential Security Services  of State (DGSSIE), holding the position of deputy commander of the infantry group. \nDéby's first experience of combat came in April 2006 when rebels attacked Chad's capital. He then participated in combat in the east of the country, alongside General Abu Bakr al-Said, director-general of the gendarmerie. Following the campaign, Déby was promoted to the rank of major.\nIn January 2013, Déby was appointed second in command of the Chadian armed forces in Mali, under the command of General Oumar Bikimo. \nFollowing his father's death at the hands of the Front for Change and Concord in Chad (FACT) rebels on April 20, 2021, senior military officers declared they were dissolving Chad's government and parliament and installing Déby as head of a transitional military council."

 chd.1.desc:0 "President of Chad, Mahamat Déby, has resorted to an old but surefire tool to develop a further plan for combating the rebels — he has turned to witch doctors. \n\nDéby has been at his headquarters in the desert on the border with Libya, about 100 km south of the enemy's positions, for over a week.  A few days earlier, he called on the rebels, \"if they are men,\" to leave the territory of Libya and go to the Kouri Bougoudi area of the Tibesti region (on the territory of Chad), where he would not need permission from the Libyan authorities to attack. Operations are also complicated by the rebels that have mined the approaches to their positions, and by the weak support of France, without whom it is difficult to carry out logistical and reconnaissance operations.\n\nIn such a difficult situation, Mahamat Déby took an unexpected decision: he turned to the country's chief witch doctor, a colonel-sultan of the \"kingdom\" of Bagirmi (simply put, a tribal leader and concurrently a CAF officer). His Majesty has already arrived at Kouri Bougoudi and has even made a selfie confirming this fact (pictured). He is accompanied by about 10 marabouts (local religious figures) and healers. Over the next two days, they will perform special \"spiritual practices\" and consult with the \"spirits\" to assess the chances of a successful operation. As part of the rituals, 12 dromedaries have already been sacrificed, and the witch doctors themselves have retired to a tent, singing mysterious songs."

 chd.2.desc:0 "The new constitution submitted to referendum largely repeats the text of the 1996 Constitution . Unlike the 2018 situation , this one actually benefits from a better image, which is the result of extensive consultations that led to a consensus during the Sovereign National Conference organized in 1993. \n\nThe text of this new fundamental law - the eleventh since the country's independence in 1960 - thus provides for a return to the semi-presidential regime , which replaces the 2018 presidential regime, confirming the reinstatement of the post of Prime Minister as head of government. is responsible before the National Assembly , unlike the role of head of state, which is performed by the President of the Republic . The latter's mandate lasts from six to five years and is always renewable once consecutively. The minimum age for presidential candidates has been lowered from 40 to 35. The draft constitution also confirms the existence of the Senate , theoretically created by the 2018 constitution but never set up, as well as the division of the country into 23 regions or provinces. \n\nThe text is also notable for its objective of restoring several rights, concepts and democratic institutions that had been removed from the 1996 text as a result of a series of constitutional revisions under the chairmanship of Idriss Déby . Thus, in terms of the separation of powers, the proclaimed independence of the judiciary is strengthened by conferring the post of president of the Superior Council of the Judiciary no longer on the President of the Republic, but on the First President of the Supreme Court, who previously held the position of second vice-president. The High Court of Justice, placed under the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court in 2018, also regains its independence as an institution, as well as the sole power to judge the President of the Republic in the event of high treason. \n\nAs regards fundamental rights , the proposed text creates the post of Ombudsman of the Republic and enshrines in the Constitution the Independent Human Rights Commission, an administrative authority which is now officially responsible for promoting and defending individual freedoms. While maintaining the Economic, Social, Cultural and Environmental Council, the High Council of Autonomous Communities and Traditional Chiefs, as well as the High Authority for the Media and Audiovisual Communication , the new text also establishes the National Agency responsible for the 'organization of elections (ANGE). which permanently replaces the Independent National Electoral Commission (CENI), which was previously ad hoc and placed under the authority of the government. The change of name is in particular a response to a request expressed during the inclusive national dialogue, according to which CENI is considered too imbued with the experience of the authoritarian regime of Idriss Déby. \n\nThe adoption of the new constitution paves the way for the return of power to civilians, scheduled for next year through the organization of legislative and presidential elections , in which General Mahamat Idriss Déby could run."
