 RUS.1.t:0 "Formation of the African Corps!"
 RUS.1.desc:0 "Russia has completed the formation of the African Corps. Experts say that the AC is either already being deployed or is planning deployments in Burkina Faso, Libya, Mali, the Central African Republic, and Niger. The new structure will report directly to the military department. The formed corps does not resemble the Western and Asian security companies that have been operating in Africa for the past 30 years; it appears to be a 'unique product' capable of conducting combat operations.\n\nCooperation with the USSR and, later, Russia in the field of security has had a significant positive impact on African countries. It seems that the Russian Federation has decided not to abandon this legacy, beneficial to both parties."

 USR.2.t:0 "15 Years of the United States Africa Command"
 USR.2.desc:0 "In the summer of 2006, U.S. Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld initiated the creation of a planning group to advise on the organization of a new Unified Command for the African continent. This was the beginning of something new and significant, a step towards strengthening U.S. presence in a region that had long remained outside the main focus of American foreign policy.\n\nBy the winter of that year, Rumsfeld presented his recommendations to President George W. Bush, who supported the idea. It was an important decision, reflecting the U.S.'s desire to expand its influence and enhance security on the African continent.\n\nWith the arrival of 2007, the new Secretary of Defense Robert Gates officially announced the creation of the Africa Command. Rear Admiral Robert Moeller, the director of the AFRICOM transition team, began forming the command in Stuttgart, Germany. This was a practical step towards implementing the concept, which had already begun to take shape.\n\nIn September 2008, after a series of meetings with African military leaders, General William E. 'Kip' Ward was confirmed by the U.S. Senate as the first commander of AFRICOM. And from the first of October, AFRICOM began its full-fledged operation, incorporating existing structures and starting to function independently as a full-fledged combat command.\n\nThus, AFRICOM became a symbol of a new era in American military strategy, reflecting global changes and new security challenges facing the world in the 21st century."

The local population, engaged in their daily routines, can be confident in their protection.\n\nThe arrival of U.S. armored battalions at AFRICOM bases becomes a significant step in the context of global strategy. This action is seen as a substantial response to recent Russian actions in forming the African Corps. Such a move by the United States underscores its determination to maintain strategic balance and provide support to allies, striving for stability in the region.\n\nAFRICOM forces, bolstering their positions, demonstrate readiness for cooperation and interaction within the international community. This not only strengthens trust from partners but also serves as a clear signal to those attempting to disrupt peace and order on the continent.\n\nHowever, it must be understood that these battalions are not only tools of combat but symbols of hope, promising a peaceful future. The arrival of these units at AFRICOM bases is a key moment in strengthening international cooperation and maintaining order, reflecting the U.S.'s commitment to peace and stability principles.\n\nStriving for peace and stability remains a priority in U.S. policy, and current actions are a vivid confirmation of this."

This, according to the command, will allow for a rapid response to emerging crisis situations and contribute to developing local armed forces through joint exercises and training.\n\nBesides the military aspect, AFRICOM highlights the importance of humanitarian support and civil society development. Expanding aid programs aimed at improving living conditions, access to education, and medical services is proposed, contributing to long-term peace and stability in the region.\n\nIn this context, AFRICOM advocates for reallocating part of the US defense budget towards the African direction. This includes funding the construction of new facilities, acquiring modern equipment and technology, and investing in training and preparation programs.\n\nThe final element of the strategy is strengthening diplomatic ties with African countries at the highest level.
