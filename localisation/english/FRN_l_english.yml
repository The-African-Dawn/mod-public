 FRN_operation_barkhan: "Operation Barkhane"
 FRN_operation_barkhan_desc: "Operation Barkhane, despite the significant efforts and resources invested by France and its allies, has not been able to completely defeat terrorism in the Sahel region. Terrorist groups continue to pose a security threat, and this remains a serious concern for the international community. \n\nIn addition, some Sahel countries involved in the operation experienced military coups, which further complicated the political situation in the region. These events underscore the complexity of the task of ensuring stability and security in an environment where internal conflicts and political crises can negate any progress made.\n\nFrance recognizes these difficulties and reaffirms its commitment to working with the international community and local partners to find effective solutions aimed at addressing the root causes of terrorism and restoring peace and stability to the region. It is important to continue to support dialogue and cooperation to ensure long-term progress and security for all peoples of the Sahel."

 FRN_best_of_them_all_desc: "France, with its long history of presence in Africa, is one of the most active countries in the region in the modern era, especially with regards to military interventions. From the colonial period to the present day, France has maintained close ties with many African countries, which often leads to its participation in military operations on the continent.\n\nFrench military interventions in Africa are usually justified by the need to maintain stability and security, as in the case of Operation Barkhane in the Sahel. France is also actively involved in peacekeeping missions and counterterrorism operations, using its military resources to support local governments and international efforts to secure peace. \n\nThese activities are not always met with approval, and in some cases have sparked controversy and criticism from the international community and local populations. Questions about France's influence in the region, its motives, and the consequences of its actions for local countries remain the subject of debate and analysis.\n\nNevertheless, France continues to play a key role in security and development issues in Africa, emphasizing its commitment to cooperation and support for African countries in their quest for stability and prosperity."
 FRN_exchanging_experience: "Exchange of Experience"
 FRN_exchanging_experience_desc: "France is actively involved in the exchange of experience and the deployment of military advisers to allied African countries, as part of its strategy to strengthen international security and stability. These actions are aimed at supporting African partners in developing their defense capabilities and strengthening state institutions.\n\nThe exchange of experience includes conducting joint exercises, training African military personnel in France and on the ground, and providing technical and logistical support. This allows African armies to increase their combat effectiveness and the effectiveness of their operations.\n\nThe deployment of military advisers plays a key role in transferring the knowledge and skills needed to plan and conduct military operations, as well as to strengthen military-technical cooperation. French military advisers are helping African countries to develop defense strategies, train personnel, and modernize their armed forces.\n\nSuch measures not only contribute to raising the level of security in African countries, but also strengthen bilateral relations, creating a basis for long-term partnership and mutual understanding. This, in turn, leads to a more effective solution to regional conflicts and security issues."

The experience of the legion in African war conditions is characterized by high adaptability to complex climatic and tactical conditions, which allows it to effectively perform the assigned tasks."

This decision reflects France's desire to strengthen its presence and capabilities in the region, which will allow it to respond more effectively to emerging challenges and threats. The expansion of the air contingent will strengthen the operational capabilities of the French armed forces and increase their readiness to carry out various missions, from humanitarian operations to the fight against terrorism.

Support is manifested through diplomatic initiatives to create favorable international agreements, financing from state and private investment banks, as well as through access to advanced technologies and engineering knowledge. Companies like TotalEnergies and Areva are using these benefits to implement projects in Africa, which leads to the development of infrastructure and the creation of new jobs locally, but also raises discussions about the environmental consequences and the socio-economic impact on local communities."

 FRN_in_the_shadow_of_the_sun_desc: "It appears as though our efforts at home are seen by politicians as something insignificant. \nBlinded by the conflict in Europe, they are sending military aid to Ukraine, while we ourselves lack supplies and funding. \nWe hope that over time, this situation will change, and the Homeland will turn to face us again, but for now, we are forced to use our existing reserves sparingly. \nPerhaps our victories in local conflicts will help to knock more money out of the budget and make it easier to obtain new arms deliveries."

 FRN.1.desc:0 "The French zone of influence, until recently seemingly indestructible, is now crumbling before our eyes. Rage, hatred, impotence - this is what each of our soldiers is experiencing today.\n\nGeneral Eric Rice sat for a long time and reread the recent report over and over.\n\nAnother African government was overthrown by another military junta.\n\nFrance has always had a wide influence on the countries of Africa, but now this is a thing of the past. An armed mob in different parts of the continent is taking power into their own hands and establishing their own laws, and all that remains for us is to silently observe.\n\nThe French armed forces were supposed to bring security and stability to the continent, but now we are no different from a flock of bleating sheep.\n\nIs the dream of an enlightened and free Africa really going to die like this? Drowned out the noises of the Brussels bureaucracy?\n\nWe need to do something. We have to have a way out!\n\nThe future of France depends on our decision. The future of Africa."
